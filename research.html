  <p>I develop robust and trustworthy learning methods for modern biomedical data and beyond. My research draws from the following different domains.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><b>Robust and Trustworthy Machine Learning</b>: backdoor attacks, adversarial attacks, label noise, uncertainty.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Biomedical informatics</b>: digital pathology, multi-omics data analytics, spatial and topological analysis of tissue micorenvionment.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Topological data analysis</b>: learning with topological features, topology-informed image segmentation and analysis.</p></li>
  </ul>

Below are a few selected ongoing projects.

<h2>Robust and Trustworthy Machine Learning</h2>
<p>
Modern machine learning faces new challenges. Large language models, vision-language models, and foundational models exhibit unprecedented representational power, achieving state-of-the-art performance in prediction and generation tasks. However, their highly complex architectures and massive model sizes also introduce significant vulnerabilities.
</p>
<p>
Since 2021, I have been deeply engaged in the study of backdoor attacks (also known as Trojan attacks). Our team is particularly interested in investigating backdoor-induced structural signals, such as the geometry and topology of data and neuron connectivity. Notably, we were the first to identify and systematically analyze the abnormal concentration of attention on trigger words in backdoored BERT models [Lyu et al., 2022]. Building on this insight, we later developed novel data-efficient attack methods that exploit this phenomenon [Lyu et al., 2022].
</p>
<p>
Beyond the direct abnormality in attention patterns, we explored higher-order structural changes caused by backdoor attacks. We discovered that backdoored models exhibit unique topological loops in neuron connectivity, resulting from shortcuts between shallow and deep-layer neurons. This discovery led to one of the earliest backdoor detection methods [Zheng et al., 2024]. Additionally, we introduced a novel topological loss function to analyze trigger connectivity in trigger-inversion-based detection methods [Hu et al., 2023]. Our exploration of geometry and topology in robust learning also extends to adversarial robustness [Zhang et al., 2022] and label noise robustness [Wu et al., 2020].
</p>
<p>
Our research continues to evolve alongside advancements in language and vision-language models. In a recent study, we found that backdoor attacks on generative models often unintentionally disrupt the underlying language structure, compromising the coherence of triggered outputs. To mitigate this issue, we proposed "regulating" the output by ensuring that vision-language model embeddings align closely with those of a vanilla large language model [Lyu, 2024]. While this approach restores model competence, it also limits adaptability to downstream tasks due to the imposed constraints on embeddings.
</p>
<p>
Can we do better in creating competent backdoored models? The key might lie in understanding the reverse process: how are structural abnormalities removed in a global backdoor mitigation process. In our earlier work explored backdoor mitigation through knowledge distillation [Pang et al., 2023]. We demonstrated that frameworks like knowledge distillation can "smooth out" structural abnormalities introduced by backdoors without explicitly identifying them. 
</p>
<p>
Building on this, further research into the interplay between backdoor effectiveness, model generalization, and structural stability could offer deeper insights into both attack and defense mechanisms. By analyzing how backdoor mitigation methods alter model architecture and neuron connectivity, we may uncover strategies to design more adaptive and resilient backdoored models. Additionally, exploring alternative regularization techniques or fine-tuning approaches could help balance stealth, adaptability, and performance in these models.

<!--   We are analyzing highly complex data with unknown noise and potentially poisonous information from attackers. These noise or
attacks are especially dangerous to deep neural nets with strong memorization power. We investigate how to train deep nets to be robust
against <b>label noise</b>, or robust against <b>poisoning backdoor attacks</b>. Under the hood is a unified geometric
and topological view of the data in the latent representational space and in neuron correlation. We show that advanced
topological and geometric tools, if tightly coupled with deep neural networks, can provide novel
and powerful prior for robust learning. </p>

<h2>Topology-Informed Imaging Informatics</h2>
<p>Thanks to decades of technology development, we are now able to visualize in high quality complex biomedical structures such as neurons, vessels, trabeculae and breast tissues. We need innovative methods to fully exploit these structures, which encode important information about underlying biological mechanisms. We propose principled approaches to seamlessly incorporate topological information, i.e., connected components, handles, loops, and branches, into different parts of a learning pipeline. Under the hood is a formulation of the topological computation as a differentiable operator, based on the theory of topological data analysis. This leads to a series of novel methods for segmentation, generation, and analysis of these topology-rich biomedical structures. </p>

<h2>Graph Neural Networks</h2>
<p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown strong learning power for graph-structured data. We improve GNNs by introducing topological and geometric constructs such as persistent homology and graph Ricci curvature as high-order multi-scale information. These methods have shown state-of-the-art performance in different tasks such as node classification, link prediction, relation prediction, etc. Most recently, we propose a novel cycle-centric GNN, which learns useful representation of rules in knowledge graphs, through the space of cycles.</p>
